# YelloHack-1.0


This challenge steps up a little. All the real world applications that you build will involve API calls. For this challenge, you have to build a table that displays random users from randomuser.me api API.

Well, that's the easy part! 


## PART 1

Your first step would be to fetch the data from the API and display it as a table.

If you have completed this part, give yourself a clap as you have crossed the first milestone of this Hackathon!

## PART 2

### In this part you can choose <b>any one</b> of these three following tracks


1. The table must have a search feature to filter out the users based on the search input (name, gender, email). The user can click on the table headers to sort according to the selected column (ascending and descending).

  (or)

2. The users shall have the provision to select multiple rows, and export it as csv.

  (or)

3. The User Interface shall have a provision for switching between Dark Mode and Light Mode with smooth transitions using a button or some triggering UI component.


## PART 3 (BONUS)

#### Completing tasks of these part will be a bonus and get us excited about you!

In this part, we will focus on UI criterias like:
      1. Responsiveness 
      2. Cool Transitions and hover effects


## RULES

1. This is a React.js hackathon using any other framework will get you disqualified.
2. You can use CSS libraries like Bootstrap / TailwindCSS (preferred) / MaterialUI
3. We only expect you to build a React App, inclusion of any backend framework may not increase your score


### We have attached a snapshot below for UI inspiration, feel free to build on your own.
