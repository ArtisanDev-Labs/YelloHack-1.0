# YelloHack 1.0 🎯


**Welcome to YelloHack 1.0 !** 
All the real world applications that we build  involves API calls. So we have kept this challenge aligned with real world scenarios, you have to build a table that displays random users from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/)  API.

## PART 1

 - Your first step would be to fetch the data from the API and display
   it as a table. Simple.

If you have completed this part, give yourself a clap 👏 you have crossed the first milestone of this Hackathon! 💪

## PART 2

#### In this part you can choose *any one* of these three following tracks

 - The table must have a search feature to filter out the users based on
   the search input (name, gender, email). The user can click on the
   name header to sort according to the selected column (ascending and
   descending).

      (or)

 - The users must have the provision to select multiple rows, and
   export it as csv.

    (or)

 - The User Interface must have a provision for switching between Dark
   Mode and Light Mode with smooth transitions using a button or some
   triggering UI component.
