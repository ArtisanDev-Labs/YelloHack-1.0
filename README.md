# YelloHack-1.0


This challenge steps up a little. All the real world applications that you build will involve API calls. For this challenge, you have to build a table that displays random users from randomuser.me api API.

Well, that's the easy part. The table must have a search feature to filter out the users based on the search input (name, gender, email). The user can click on the table headers to sort according to the selected column (ascending and descending).

The users must have the provision to select multiple rows, and export it as csv.
